# Data Structures and Algorithms
This is a collection of assignments from [coursera: Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms) and other solutions for common question from [leetcode](https://leetcode.com).

With the hope that this repository will help many prepare for their interviews or gain indepth data structure knowledge,the repository is divided into subsections depending on the goal of each of them. 
- In Algorithmic tool box, we have the general view on algorithms and the basic algorithms and problem solving techniques
- In Data Structures and Algorithms, we have the solutions to problems with particular DS as sub directories.

More information n contributions and extra resources will be shared here as we keep on having updates.
# Thank you :muscle:
