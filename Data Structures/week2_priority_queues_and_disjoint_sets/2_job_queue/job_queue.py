"""Simulation of a program that processes a list of jobs in parallel.
Samples:
>>> job_queue = JobQueue()
>>> job_queue.num_workers = 2
>>> job_queue.jobs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> job_queue.assign_jobs()
>>> job_queue.write_response()

>>> # Explanation:
>>> # 1. The two threads try to simultaneously take jobs from the list, so
>>> # thread with index 0 actually takes the first job and starts
>>> # working on it at the moment 0.
>>> # 2. The thread with index 1 takes the second job and starts
>>> # working on it also at the moment 0.
>>> # 3. After 1 second, thread 0 is done with the first job and takes
>>> # the third job from the list, and starts processing it immediately
>>> # at time 1.
>>> # 4. One second later, thread 1 is done with the second job and takes
>>> # the fourth job from the list, and starts processing it immediately
>>> # at time 2.
>>> # 5. Finally, after 2 more seconds, thread 0 is done with the third job
>>> # and takes the fifth job from the list, and starts processing it
>>> # immediately at time 4.
>>> job_queue = JobQueue()
>>> job_queue.num_workers = 4
>>> job_queue.jobs = [1] * 20
>>> job_queue.assign_jobs()
>>> job_queue.write_response()
